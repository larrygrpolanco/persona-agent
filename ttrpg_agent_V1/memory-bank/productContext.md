# Product Context: TTRPG Generative Agent

## Why This Project Exists

The original "Generative Agents" research demonstrated AI agents with memory, planning, and reflection capabilities that could simulate human-like behavior in a 2D town environment. These agents followed daily schedules, interacted with each other, and built relationships over time. While impressive, this simulation was focused on everyday activities and spatial navigation.

Our project aims to adapt this architecture for a more focused and narrative-driven context: tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). Specifically, we're targeting the game ECH0, which provides a structured yet open-ended storytelling framework.

## Problems We're Solving

1. **TTRPG Accessibility**: TTRPGs like ECH0 require multiple players, which can be a barrier to entry. A generative agent that can play a role (Pilot or Child) would allow for solo play or smaller groups.

2. **Consistent Character Portrayal**: Human players may struggle with consistent role-playing over long sessions. A generative agent can maintain character consistency through its memory and reflection systems.

3. **Dynamic Storytelling**: Current AI storytelling tools often lack memory of previous interactions, leading to narrative inconsistencies. The memory stream architecture from Generative Agents can create more coherent and evolving narratives.

4. **Testing Ground for AI Agents**: TTRPGs provide clear rules and roles, making them an ideal testing ground for generative agents before deploying them in more complex environments.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Immersive Role-Playing**: The agent should feel like a believable character within the ECH0 world, with appropriate knowledge, emotions, and motivations based on its role.

2. **Narrative Continuity**: The agent should remember past events, characters, and locations from the game, referencing them naturally in conversation and decision-making.

3. **Collaborative Storytelling**: The agent should contribute meaningfully to the narrative, not just responding to prompts but also introducing new elements and perspectives based on its character.

4. **Adaptability**: The agent should adjust to unexpected player actions while maintaining its character and the game's narrative structure.

## How This Differs From Original Generative Agents

1. **Text-Based vs. Spatial**: The original agents navigated a 2D environment with visual perception. Our agents will process and generate text, understanding narrative descriptions rather than spatial coordinates.

2. **Role-Constrained vs. Open-Ended**: The original agents had general human-like behavior with broad goals. Our agents will have specific roles (Pilot or Child) with defined characteristics and objectives within the ECH0 game structure.

3. **Narrative Focus vs. Daily Activities**: The original agents followed daily schedules (eating, sleeping, working). Our agents will focus on storytelling, world-building, and character development within a narrative arc.

4. **Game Rules vs. Social Simulation**: The original agents operated in a social simulation with emergent behavior. Our agents will operate within the constraints and structure of the ECH0 game rules, while still maintaining believable character behavior.

## Target Use Case

A player wants to experience the ECH0 game but doesn't have enough people to play with. They initialize the agent as either the Pilot (a ghost of a dead mech pilot seeking their final resting place) or one of the Children (who found the Pilot's ECH0 drive). The player and agent then engage in the game, taking turns describing scenes, asking questions, and building the narrative together according to the game's structure.
