# Active Context: TTRPG Generative Agent

## Current Focus

The project has completed a major architectural refactor: **all maze, tile, and spatial logic has been removed** from the TTRPG agent's codebase. The agent is now fully narrative/text-based, processing only text input and generating narrative responses. The test harness, Persona class, and all cognitive modules (perceive, plan, execute) are now decoupled from the original simulation environment.

## Active Decisions

1. **Maze/Spatial Removal**: All code and dependencies related to the maze, tiles, spatial memory, and 2D navigation have been deleted or bypassed. The agent no longer expects or processes any spatial context.
2. **Narrative-Only Perception**: The perception system now simply records what is told to the agent as memory. There is no scanning or filtering of an environment.
3. **Narrative-Only Planning/Execution**: Planning and execution are now based solely on narrative memory and context. The agent's "actions" are narrative responses, not movements or object manipulations.
4. **Test Harness Simplification**: The test harness now passes text input directly to the agent's cognitive loop, with no mock maze or spatial event handling.
5. **Legacy Compatibility**: Some function signatures retain unused parameters (maze, personas) for compatibility, but these are always passed as None and ignored internally.

## Current Challenges

1. **Legacy Code and Event Structure**: Many parts of the codebase expect structured event objects (with attributes like `.description`), not raw tuples or strings. As a result, errors will surface in various modules (e.g., retrieve, plan, execute) when they try to access attributes that no longer exist. These must be found and refactored iteratively.
2. **Memory/Event Structures**: The agent's memory system is now narrative-focused, but some structures (e.g., spatial memory) are still present for compatibility.
3. **Testing and Iterative Refactor**: The system must be tested thoroughly. Expect to encounter many errors as you trace through the codebase, fixing each place where legacy expectations (attributes, object types) do not match the new narrative event format. This will be an ongoing, error-driven process due to the codebase's complexity and interdependencies.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Test the agent with various narrative inputs to surface errors related to legacy event/object expectations.
2. For each error, trace the code to the source and refactor the relevant function/module to work with the new narrative event format (tuples or strings).
3. Remove any remaining legacy code or parameters that are no longer needed.
4. Begin adapting the planning and reflection systems for richer narrative and character development, now that the spatial layer is gone.

## Recent Learnings

- The original architecture's deep integration with spatial logic required a careful, multi-step refactor.
- The agent's core cognitive loop (perceive → retrieve → plan → reflect → execute) is robust and can be adapted to a pure narrative context with minimal changes once spatial dependencies are removed.
- The test harness is now a clean interface for TTRPG agent development and testing.

## Current Insights

- The agent is now well-positioned for further TTRPG-specific enhancements, such as richer narrative planning, character-driven reflection, and more sophisticated memory retrieval.
- The codebase is much simpler and easier to maintain without the spatial layer.
