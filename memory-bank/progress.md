# Progress: TTRPG Generative Agent

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure established for project documentation and context continuity.
- Project goals, product context, system patterns, and technical context are clearly defined.
- Comprehensive analysis of the original generative agent architecture completed.
- Stepwise plan for TTRPG agent rebuild is in place, focusing on narrative-driven, LLM-powered cognition.

## What's Left to Build
- Implement the minimal Persona class and narrative-focused memory system.
- Refactor and implement cognitive modules (perceive, retrieve, plan, reflect, execute, converse) for narrative input/output.
- Develop and test narrative-focused prompt templates for LLM-driven cognition.
- Build a CLI or script-based test harness for agent interaction and debugging.
- Expand for multi-agent support and campaign persistence.
- Document all new modules and update Memory Bank as the project evolves.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank core files are complete and up to date.
- Project is ready to begin implementation of the foundational agent code.

## Known Issues
- No code yet for the new narrative-driven agent; all work so far is architectural and planning.
- Original codebase is deeply simulation-coupled; careful refactoring is required to avoid legacy dependencies.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from simulation-based agent to narrative-first, LLM-driven architecture.
- Committed to modular, prompt-oriented cognitive modules and persistent, inspectable memory.
- Prioritized documentation and context continuity via the Memory Bank for long-term maintainability.
