# Progress: TTRPG Generative Agent

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Planning and Initial Setup

We have completed the planning phase of the project and established the Memory Bank documentation. We are now ready to begin implementation of the standalone test harness.

## What Works

- ✅ Project vision and goals defined
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation established
- ✅ Understanding of original Generative Agents architecture
- ✅ Identification of key challenges for TTRPG adaptation
- ✅ Implementation plan created

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Standalone Test Harness (Current Focus)

- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Copy relevant code from original codebase
- [ ] Implement mock classes for dependencies
- [ ] Adapt Persona initialization for TTRPG roles
- [ ] Create text input processing
- [ ] Implement basic test loop
- [ ] Verify memory formation and retrieval
- [ ] Test basic cognitive cycle

### Phase 2: TTRPG Adaptation

- [ ] Replace spatial perception with text parsing
- [ ] Adapt planning for narrative contributions
- [ ] Implement role-specific behavior (Pilot/Child)
- [ ] Create game state tracking
- [ ] Enhance reflection for character development
- [ ] Improve memory retrieval for narrative relevance

### Phase 3: Refinement and Testing

- [ ] Tune memory importance scoring
- [ ] Optimize LLM prompts for TTRPG context
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Create user interface for interaction
- [ ] Document API and usage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (Current)

We've decided to start with a minimal modification approach, focusing on:
1. Mocking dependencies rather than rewriting functionality
2. Understanding the core cognitive loop before making substantial changes
3. Testing each component individually

This approach allows us to leverage the existing architecture while gradually adapting it for TTRPG use.

### Key Decision Points

1. **Maze Dependency**: We've decided to create a comprehensive mock of the Maze class rather than removing all references to it. This will allow us to understand how it's used throughout the codebase before making more substantial changes.

2. **Memory Structures**: We've decided to keep the existing memory structures (associative memory, spatial memory, scratch) initially, even though spatial memory may seem less relevant for a text-based environment. This will help us understand how these components interact before deciding what to modify or remove.

3. **Cognitive Cycle**: We've decided to maintain the original cognitive cycle (perceive → retrieve → plan → reflect → execute) but adapt each component for text-based input/output rather than changing the overall architecture.

## First Milestone Goal

Our first milestone is to create a standalone test harness that can:
1. Initialize a Persona with either the Pilot or Child role
2. Accept text input describing game events
3. Process that input through the cognitive cycle
4. Generate appropriate responses
5. Demonstrate memory formation and retrieval

Success will be measured by the agent's ability to:
- Store input text as memories
- Retrieve relevant memories when needed
- Generate responses that are consistent with its role and past experiences
- Reflect on its experiences to form higher-level insights

## Known Issues and Risks

1. **Deep Integration**: The original codebase has deep integration between components, making it challenging to isolate and adapt individual parts.

2. **LLM Dependency**: The system relies heavily on LLMs, which may introduce inconsistency and require careful prompt engineering.

3. **Conceptual Mapping**: Mapping concepts from a spatial simulation to a narrative context may require more substantial changes than initially anticipated.

4. **Performance**: The original system was designed for a small number of agents in a controlled environment. Performance may be an issue for real-time TTRPG interaction.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create the `ttrpg_agent/` directory
2. Copy the `persona/` directory from the original codebase
3. Create `mocks.py` with initial mock implementations
4. Create `test_harness.py` with basic functionality
5. Test Persona initialization with a simple role
