# Progress: TTRPG Generative Agent

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Narrative-Only Refactor Complete

The project has completed a major refactor: all maze, tile, and spatial logic has been removed. The agent is now fully narrative/text-based, processing only text input and generating narrative responses. The test harness, Persona class, and all cognitive modules (perceive, plan, execute) are now decoupled from the original simulation environment.

## What Works

- ✅ Project vision and goals defined
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation established
- ✅ Understanding of original Generative Agents architecture
- ✅ Identification of key challenges for TTRPG adaptation
- ✅ Implementation plan created
- ✅ Standalone test harness for text-based agent
- ✅ All spatial/maze logic removed from codebase
- ✅ Perception, planning, and execution are now narrative-only
- ✅ Test harness passes text input directly to agent's cognitive loop

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Test the agent with various narrative inputs to surface errors related to legacy event/object expectations (e.g., code expecting `.description` on events).
- [ ] For each error, trace the code to the source and refactor the relevant function/module to work with the new narrative event format (tuples or strings).
- [ ] Remove any remaining legacy code or parameters that are no longer needed.
- [ ] Begin adapting the planning and reflection systems for richer narrative and character development, now that the spatial layer is gone.

### Phase 2: TTRPG Adaptation

- [ ] Enhance planning for narrative contributions and character goals
- [ ] Implement role-specific behavior (Pilot/Child)
- [ ] Create game state tracking for ECH0
- [ ] Improve memory retrieval for narrative relevance

### Phase 3: Refinement and Testing

- [ ] Tune memory importance scoring for narrative context
- [ ] Optimize LLM prompts for TTRPG use
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Create user interface for interaction
- [ ] Document API and usage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Major Milestone

- **Maze/Spatial Removal**: All code and dependencies related to the maze, tiles, spatial memory, and 2D navigation have been deleted or bypassed. The agent no longer expects or processes any spatial context.
- **Narrative-Only Pipeline**: The agent's cognitive loop is now fully narrative/text-based, with all planning and execution based on memory and context from text input.

### Key Decision Points

- **Legacy Compatibility**: Some function signatures retain unused parameters (maze, personas) for compatibility, but these are always passed as None and ignored internally.
- **Memory/Event Structures**: The agent's memory system is now narrative-focused, but some structures (e.g., spatial memory) are still present for compatibility.

## First Milestone Goal

**Achieved:** The agent can now process text input, store it as memory, and generate a narrative response, with no reference to spatial logic.

## Known Issues and Risks

1. **Legacy Code and Event Structure**: Many parts of the codebase expect structured event objects (with attributes like `.description`), not raw tuples or strings. As a result, errors will surface in various modules (e.g., retrieve, plan, execute) when they try to access attributes that no longer exist. These must be found and refactored iteratively.
2. **Testing and Iterative Refactor**: The system must be tested thoroughly. Expect to encounter many errors as you trace through the codebase, fixing each place where legacy expectations (attributes, object types) do not match the new narrative event format. This will be an ongoing, error-driven process due to the codebase's complexity and interdependencies.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Test the agent with various narrative inputs to surface errors related to legacy event/object expectations.
2. For each error, trace the code to the source and refactor the relevant function/module to work with the new narrative event format (tuples or strings).
3. Remove any remaining legacy code or parameters that are no longer needed.
4. Begin adapting the planning and reflection systems for richer narrative and character development, now that the spatial layer is gone.
