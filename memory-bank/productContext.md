# Product Context: TTRPG Generative Agent

## Why This Project Exists
The project aims to bring the power of generative agents—originally designed for simulated environments—into the realm of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs). By focusing on narrative-driven cognition, memory, and planning, the agent will serve as a believable, context-aware player or NPC, enhancing immersion and storytelling.

## Problems It Solves
- Traditional TTRPG bots lack memory, context, and believable character continuity.
- Existing generative agent code is deeply tied to simulation and not adaptable for narrative play.
- GMs and players need tools for richer, more dynamic character interactions and worldbuilding.

## How It Should Work
- The agent receives narrative input (scene descriptions, dialogue, GM narration) and processes it as "perception."
- It retrieves relevant memories, plans its next narrative action or utterance, and reflects on recent events to evolve its character.
- All actions and dialogue are LLM-driven, context-aware, and memory-informed.
- The agent can be used as a player, NPC, or worldbuilding assistant in any TTRPG setting.

## User Experience Goals
- Seamless integration into TTRPG sessions (CLI, chat, or future API).
- Believable, consistent character behavior and memory.
- Transparent, inspectable memory and reasoning for debugging or GM oversight.
- Extensible for custom settings, rules, and campaign persistence.
